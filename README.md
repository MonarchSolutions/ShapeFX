# ShapeFX

ShapeFX unifies under a simple API the 3 most common Dynamic Compilation engines for C#, Roslyn, CodeDom and Mono CSharp Compiler.

If you want to start playing around with Dynamic Compilation and don't know where to start or don't have time to be caught in all the compiler specific settings and details, ShapeFX is your new best friend. Just handle it a C# class as a string, choose the compilation engine you want and see your type generated at runtime ready to be used inside your app.

ShapeFX is built with extensibility in mind so you can even plug in other compilation engines besides the ones mentioned above.
