# ShapeFX
Dynamic Compilation Engines Aggregator Library for .NET
ShapeFX unifies under a simple API Roslyn, CodeDom and Mono CSharp Compiler but other engines can be plugged in as well.
If you want to start playing around with Dynamic Compilation on your apps and don't want to loose time having to learn all the settings and details, ShapeFX is your friend. Just handle it a C# class as a string, choose the compilation engine you want and see your type generated at runtime.
